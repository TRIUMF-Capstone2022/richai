## A.1: Momentum vs ring radius 

The difference in the ring radius of the light generated by the pion and muon is a function of the momentum, as seen in {numref}`p_vs_rr`. The difference is greatest at low momentums, and continually diminishes until there is convergence at values of momentum greater than 45 $GeV/c$. From this phenomenon arises the natural range of momentum for this analysis,  15 $GeV/c$ to  45 $GeV/c$. This naturally leads to two main areas of focus for this study: maximize the pion efficiency where there is a substantial difference in the ring sizes and expand the range of identification to higehr momentums. 

- distinction 
- range of operatoin
- areas of concern

 ## A.2: Prior performance using Maximum Likelihood Estimate Algorithm 

The current method utilized at the NA62 experiment is based on a maximum likelihood fit to determine the identity of a particle based on the scatter of photon hits generated from the RICH detector {numref}`prior_performance` {cite}`article`. The pion efficiency decreases significantly for a momentum range past 30 $GeV/c$, and the muon efficiency increases sharply. This is as expected due to the smaller differene in the ring radii as discussed above. Hence there is a scope to imporve the overall efficiencies, with a special focus on the higher momentum bins.

## A.3: Verification of Maximum Likelihood Esitmate Ring Radius 

- current performance and objective

To verify the validity of the ring radii generated using maximum likelihood fits, these values were compared to the analytical ring radius computed using standard physics formulae. As {numref}`prior_performance` shows , there is a close agreement in these two values as each distribution is normal and centered around zero. This is true for all momentum values in the range of the analysis. Hence it is appropriate to use this as a feature into the machine learning models. This plot also indicates that the challenge lies in distinguishing between two ring radii for a given momentum rather than the accuracy of the fit, even at higher momentum values.
