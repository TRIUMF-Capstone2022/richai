## Appendix D.2: Model hyperparamters 

The hyperparameters that were tuned were:

- Time delta between the hit time and the CHOD time, for which values of 0.20ns to 0.50ns were used
- Learning rate, for which a constant learning rate and a learning rate scheduler were used
- Number of epochs, for which a maximum of 24 epochs were used
- $k$ for the K-nearest neighbours graph that is dynamically generated by the models architecture, which ranged from 8 to 20 nearest neighbors
