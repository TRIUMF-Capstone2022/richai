# Conclusions and recommendations

The RICH AI project aimed to predict the particle in concern as pion or muon with given input features extracted from experiment data. This pertained to a binary classification problem. The goal was to create better and more accurate models using deep learning based classification models in comparison to the existing analytical methods. 

The data product designed in this capstone project by building two deep learning based classifiers addresses this problem by accurate extracting features from the data. The product successfully addresses the classification problem and achieves the goals with much more accurate results than the analytical method in terms of the evaluation metrics. The models may perform better with more training data while due consideration to the momentum distributions.

The above models were an attempt to implement point clouds based deep learning models at a level pertaining mostly to the vanilla architectures. Going forward, more customizations and hyperparameter tunings as well as complex models such as PointNet++ could be tried to experiment further and see if the results improve.
