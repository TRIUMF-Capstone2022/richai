# 1. Introduction

The NA62 experiment at CERN (European organization for nuclear research) studies the rate of the ultra-rate meson decay into a pion to verify the Standard Model in physics. However, a muon and positron may be produced in the decay as noise events. The latter can be identified experimentally, however it is difficult to distinguish between the pion and muon. 

 "*RICH AI*", initiated by TRIUMF (Canada's national particle accelerator center), is aimed at improving Particle Identification (PID) performance of the Ring Imaging Cherenkov (RICH) by developing a binary classification model based on advanced Machine Learning (ML).  The classification will be based on the fundamental difference in the ring size generated by either particle at a specific momentum value.

The main challenge in this project is to increase pion efficiency, that is, the fraction of the matched detected pions out of the total number of pion producing events. Concurrently the muon efficiency needs to be maximized, which translates to minimizing the number of muons that are misclassified as pions out of the total muon events. These metrics will be compared to the output of the current method used for classification, the Maximum Likelihood Estimation, for events with momentum in the range of 15-45 GeV/c.

Ultimately, the output of the project is a repository containing fully modularized code for the classification. The scientists are able to  select the dataset and hyperparameters, run the classification in the backend, and view the results along with the evaluation metrics as the output.
