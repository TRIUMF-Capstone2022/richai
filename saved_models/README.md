# Saved models

Note that due to the size of the trained PyTorch models, they have not been hosted on the remote repository here.  Rather, they are saved on the `triumf-ml1` server, at the following location:

```
/fast_scratch_1/capstone_2022/models/
```

This directory is kept in the project structure as a convenience to save any future models in your local repository if desired.
